This work mainly focuses on making predictions of live-birth occurrence when an embryo forms from a couple. Here, we compare various AI algorithms, including both classical ML, deep learning architecture, and an ensemble of algorithms on the publicly available dataset provided by Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority (HFEA).
