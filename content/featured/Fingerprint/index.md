An approach has been proposed to find the region of interest (ROI) which is based on dividing the image into blocks. Blocks of 8 images are compared in terms of ‘Histogram of Oriented Gradients (HOG) Descriptor’ and the error is calculated. The group of error points in each block is considered to be a cluster. The cluster which is less scattered would be the region of interest (ROI).
